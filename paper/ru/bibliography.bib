% ModernBERT model
@article{Warner2024ModernBERT,
   abstract = {Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger decoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its release. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native 8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.},

% LSTM model
@article{Hochreiter1997LSTM,
   abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In this work,we address the need by pretraining a financial domain specific BERT models, FinBERT, using a large scale of financial communication corpora. Experiments on three financial sentiment classification tasks confirm the advantage of FinBERT over generic domain BERT model. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/yya518/FinBERT. We hope this will be useful for practitioners and researchers working on financial NLP tasks.},

General-purpose models are not effective enough because of the specialized language used in a financial context. We hypothesize that pre-trained language models can help with this problem because they require fewer labeled examples and they can be further trained on domain-specific corpora. We introduce FinBERT, a language model based on BERT, to tackle NLP tasks in the financial domain. Our results show improvement in every measured metric on current state-of-the-art results for two financial sentiment analysis datasets. We find that even with a smaller training set and fine-tuning only a part of the model, FinBERT outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods.},

@techReport{Liu2020FinBERT,
   abstract = {There is growing interest in the tasks of financial text mining. Over the past few years, the progress of Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on deep learning advanced rapidly. Significant progress has been made with deep learning showing promising results on financial text mining models. However, as NLP models require large amounts of labeled training data, applying deep learning to financial text mining is often unsuccessful due to the lack of labeled training data in financial fields. To address this issue, we present FinBERT (BERT for Financial Text Mining) that is a domain specific language model pre-trained on large-scale financial corpora. In FinBERT, different from BERT, we construct six pre-training tasks covering more knowledge, simultaneously trained on general corpora and financial domain corpora, which can enable FinBERT model better to capture language knowledge and semantic information. The results show that our FinBERT outper-forms all current state-of-the-art models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FinBERT. The source code and pre-trained models of FinBERT are available on-line.},

   abstract = {Document processing is a foundational pre-processing task in natural language application applied in the financial domain. In this paper, we present the result of FinSBD-3, the 3rd shared task on Structure Boundary Detection in unstructured text in the financial domain. The shared task is organized as part of the 1st Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web. Participants were asked to create system detecting the boundaries of elements in unstructured text extracted from financial PDF. This edition extends the previous shared tasks by adding boundaries of visual elements such as tables, figures, page headers and page footers; on top of sentences, lists and list items which were already present in previous edition of the shared tasks.},

    abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces and other augmentative and alternative communication devices introduce language-modeing challenges distinct from other character-entry methods. In particular, the acquired signal of the EEG (electroencephalogram) signal is noisier, which, in turn, makes the user intent harder to decipher. In order to adapt to this condition, we propose to maintain ambiguous history for every time step, and to employ, apart from the character language model, word information to produce a more robust prediction system. We present preliminary results that compare this proposed Online-Context Language Model (OCLM) to current algorithms that are used in this type of setting. Evaluation on both perplexity and predictive accuracy demonstrates promising results when dealing with ambiguous histories in order to provide to the front end a distribution of the next character the user might type.}
